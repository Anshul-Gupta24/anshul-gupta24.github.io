We worked on building an automatic detector of cancerous regions in brain histopathology slides. This is a difficult problem due to the large size of the images, and analysis required at multiple scales.
We used the mobilenet architecture and analysed the image at three different scales to spot suspicious regions at increasing levels of granularity.
