We worked on understanding an implementing a computational model for theory of mind. Theory of mind is the ability to attribute mental states — beliefs, intents, desires, emotions, knowledge, etc. — to oneself, and to others, and to understand that others have beliefs, desires, intentions, and perspectives that are different from one's own.

The model was formulated as an inverse reinforcement learning problem where the environment is partially observable. The model tries to infer the agent's desires and beliefs by looking at its movements.
