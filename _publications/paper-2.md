title: "Second Language Transfer Learning in Humans and Machines Using Image Supervision"
collection: publications
excerpt: '**Abstract**: In the task of language learning, humans exhibit remarkable ability
to learn new words from a foreign language with very few instances
of image supervision. The question therefore is whether such transfer learning efficiency can be simulated in machines. In this paper,
we propose a deep semantic model for transfer learning words from a
foreign language (Japanese) using image supervision. The proposed
model is a deep audio-visual correspondence network that uses a
proxy based triplet loss. The model is trained with large dataset of
multi-modal speech/image input in the native language (English).
Then, a subset of the model parameters of the audio network are
transfer learned to the foreign language words using proxy vectors
from the image modality. Using the proxy based learning approach,
we show that the proposed machine model achieves transfer learning
performance for an image retrieval task which is comparable to the
human performance. We also present an analysis that contrasts the
errors made by humans and machines in this task.'
