I am a final year integrated masters (bachelors + masters) student at IIIT Bangalore studying computer science. I am interested in Machine Learning and Neuroscience and would like to use insights from each field to benefit the other. I interned at the RIKEN Brain Science Institute (now RIKEN Centre for Brain Science) in the summer of 2017, and am currently working with Prof. Sriram Ganapathy at the Indian Institute of Science as a project associate. I am also affiliated with the Multimodal Perception Lab (Prof. Dinesh Babu Jayagopi) at IIIT Bangalore.

I have primarily been working in the area of computer vision recently but have dabbled in all areas related to machine learning including NLP, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. I believe that we have only touched the tip of what this field offers and need new interdisciplinary approaches to achieve true Artificial General Intelligence. My internship at RIKEN sparked my curiosity in the way neuroscience and AI can interact, and I am currently trying to work on projects at the intersection of the two fields. 

When not reading up on cool new projects, I can be found playing table-tennis, drawing comics, or devouring pop culture.
