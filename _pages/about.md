I am a Computer Vision engineer at Mercedes Benz Research and Development, Bangalore working on developing intelligent interiors to enhance user experience. Some projects we are working on include gesture recognition, head pose estimation, hand localization and classification. I recently graduated from the Integrated Masters (Bachelors + Masters) program at IIIT Bangalore. My thesis was on the topic of ‘Second Language Learning in Deep Semantic Models and Humans’ under the guidance of Prof. Dinesh Jayagopi from IIIT Bangalore and Prof. Sriram Ganapathy from IISc.

I am interested in building machines that think like humans. To achieve this objective I believe it is necessary to get insight from different fields. I have worked on Multimodal and interdisciplinary projects as a step in this direction. In the past I have also interned at the RIKEN Brain Science Institute (now RIKEN Centre for Brain Science) as part of their summer program.  

I enjoy playing table-tennis, drawing comics and consuming pop culture.
